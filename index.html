            <h1>Machine Learning Tutorial</h1><br>
            <p>
                <b>Machine learning (ML)</b> allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions on new data. It is used in various applications like image recognition, speech processing, language translation, recommender systems, etc. In this article, we will see more about ML and its core concepts.

        <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2><br>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into three main types based on their learning approach and the nature of the data they work with.</p><br>
        
        <h3>Supervised Learning</h3><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Involves training models using labeled datasets. Both input and output variables are provided during training.</li><br>
            <li>The aim is to establish a mapping function that predicts outcomes for new, unseen data.</li><br>
            <li>Common applications include classification, regression, and forecasting.</li><br>
        </ul><br>

        <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3><br>
